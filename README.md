## What is this?

A basic Pixijs V5 + Typescript setup.

### Webpack config has support for:
* `Typescript`
* `png` images
* `css` files
* `woff` and `woff2` fonts
* `mp3` audio
* `GLSL` shaders

Optional `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` commented out. Can be used to analyze dependency sizes.
There is no `index.html` file, in its place we have a `template.ejs` file.
